</h1>

**The "web-page-scraper-translator" project is an application that performs web scraping of pages in different languages 
and then uses a translation service to translate the content into a specific language.**

&emsp;**The goal of the application is to allow users to obtain relevant information from different sources on the internet, 
even if it is available in languages they do not speak. The application aims to make access to information more 
democratic and accessible to a wider audience.**

&emsp;**The project is developed in Python and uses libraries to perform web scraping. In addition, it also integrates 
third-party translation services to translate the content.**
